## Test Cases

This section contains **Test Cases** used to validate individual functionalities of software applications. Each test case includes:

- **Test Steps**: A sequence of actions to perform the test.
- **Expected Results**: The expected outcome based on the functionality of the application.
- **Preconditions**: Any setup or conditions required before the test can be executed.
- **Postconditions**: The state of the system after the test is completed.
- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: How to determine whether the test passed or failed.

Test Cases are the building blocks of testing and ensure each feature works as expected.
